# 🚀 Keep Your Render Backend Awake - Setup Guide

## The Problem
Render's free tier puts your server to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. When a user visits after that, they experience a 30-60 second "cold start" delay. This is a poor user experience!

## The Solution
Use **UptimeRobot** (a free monitoring service) to ping your backend every 5 minutes, keeping it awake 24/7.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Render Backend URL

1. Go to your [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click on your **campuskart-backend** service
3. Copy your URL (looks like: `https://campuskart-backend-abc123.onrender.com`)

### Step 2: Sign Up for UptimeRobot (Free Forever)

### Step 3: Add Your Backend Monitor

   **Monitoring Interval:** `5 minutes` (free plan allows 5 minutes minimum)
   
   **Monitor Timeout:** `30 seconds`
   
   **HTTP Method:** `GET`

## 🔍 Alternative: Cron-Job.org (If you prefer)

If you don't want to use UptimeRobot, you can use [Cron-Job.org](https://cron-job.org):

1. Sign up at [cron-job.org/en/signup](https://cron-job.org/en/signup)
2. Create a new cronjob:
   - **URL:** `https://your-render-url.onrender.com/ping`
   - **Schedule:** Every 5 minutes
   - **Execution:** GET request
3. Save and enable

## 📊 Monitor Your Server

After setup, you can:

- Check UptimeRobot dashboard for uptime stats
- Get email alerts if your server goes down
- View response times and performance
- Monitor from your phone with UptimeRobot mobile app

---

## 🎯 Health Check Endpoints

Your backend now has these endpoints for monitoring:

- **`/api/health`** - Detailed health info (JSON)
- **`/ping`** - Simple ping response (text)

Both keep the server awake and can be used for monitoring.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use `/api/health`** for UptimeRobot - gives you detailed info
2. **Set alerts** in UptimeRobot to know when server is down
3. **Check logs** in Render to see ping activity
4. **Don't ping too often** - 5 minutes is perfect (avoids rate limits)

---

## 🚀 You're Done!

Your Campus-Kart backend will now:
- ✅ Stay awake 24/7
- ✅ Load instantly for all users
- ✅ Be monitored for downtime
- ✅ Provide a professional experience

**Estimated setup time:** 3 minutes

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
